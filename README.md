Hello, I'm Cromatin.


I love starting new projects and learning all sorts of things along the way. Unfortunately, I have the bad habit of starting a project and then ~~sometimes~~ often not continuing it once I’m done investigating the part which was the reason why I started the project in the first place.
I am generally interested in everything that has to do with computers and or mechanic. Maybe just because I'm fascinated by what you can do with them.

 
See ya
